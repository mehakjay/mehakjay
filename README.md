# HI GUYS 🌠🔅,

I’m Mehak Jay, a Computer Science student at UT Dallas. I’m really glad to be here and share some of the projects I’ve been working on. I love exploring new ideas, learning through trial and error, and building things that feel useful and enjoyable. I’m still growing my skills, but every project teaches me something new, and that’s what keeps me excited about programming.
