### 🌿 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at UT Dallas who enjoys building small, thoughtful projects while steadily growing my skills. I learn best by experimenting, making mistakes, and understanding *why* things work — not just getting output.

I’m especially interested in cybersecurity, problem-solving, and writing clean, readable code. Every project here represents a step forward in my journey.
