### 🌙 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at UT Dallas who enjoys building small, thoughtful projects while steadily growing my skills. I like learning by experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and understanding *why* things work — not just making them work.

I’m still early in my journey, but every project teaches me something new, and that’s what keeps me excited about programming.
